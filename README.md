# CQRS Pattern: Command Query Responsibility Segregation for Customer Digital Journey

This repository showcases the implementation of the **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** pattern to optimize scalability, maintainability, and performance in a customer-centric digital journey. 

## Overview

The architecture separates **Query Side Services** (read-focused) and **Command Side Services** (write-focused) to handle specific responsibilities efficiently while maintaining system flexibility.

### Key Components

#### Query Side Services
- **Restrictive Validations**: Ensures compliance with business rules and eligibility criteria.  
- **Customer CRM**: Retrieves customer information from the CRM system to support decision-making.  
- **Credit Record**: Accesses credit bureau data to evaluate customer creditworthiness.  
- **CDP (Customer Data Platform)**: Aggregates customer data from various sources to enable personalized experiences.  
- **Citizen Validation**: Verifies customer identity using external databases for enhanced security.  

#### Command Side Services
- **Product Issuance**: Orchestrates product creation and provisioning workflows.  
- **Notifications and Welcome Package**: Automates delivery of customer notifications and onboarding materials.  
- **Logistics Management**: Manages product shipment and delivery processes.  
- **Customer CRM Update**: Synchronizes updated customer data into the CRM system.  
- **Stock Update**: Dynamically adjusts inventory levels in real-time.  
- **Compensations**: Handles refunds, returns, and other customer compensations efficiently.  

#### Event Broker
The **Event Broker** enables asynchronous communication between services, decoupling responsibilities and supporting scalability through event-driven processing.

### Use Case: Customer Digital Journey
The CQRS implementation supports the following processes:
1. Customer data validation and retrieval during product selection.  
2. Smooth execution of agreements and product issuance.  
3. Efficient management of logistics, notifications, and compensations.  

### Additional Integration: Software Control and Testing
The diagram includes a **custom switch matrix** integrated with hardware tools like a vector signal generator, spectrum analyzer, and network analyzer. This setup ensures system reliability and validation during operations.

## Benefits of CQRS
- Improved scalability by separating read and write operations.  
- Enhanced performance for high-demand systems.  
- Easier maintainability with decoupled responsibilities.  
- Better user experience through seamless workflows and modular services.
